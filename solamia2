The beautiful woman says 'Ah, the oath of the Knights. Good day to
you. You know, this stone was once the location of the fasting and
prayer of the great Vinas Solamnus? It was said that after three days
of penitence and devotion he was visited by the three high gods of
good to which your order belongs.'

After looking at you with eyes that seem to pierce your soul, she
continues 'Being a Knight of the Crown, you know about the Blue
Phoenix, Habbakuk. He was the first to come and visit Vinas showing
the loyalty and obedience of the first order.'

After a few moments of thought, she continues 'Second, Kiri-Jolith
appeared as a bison headed constellation in the sky and the second
order was created to encapsulate courage and self sacrifice. Finally,
the great platinum dragon Paladine appeared made of only the
brightest stars in the sky and the third order was solidified in
Vinas' mind as the force of justice.'

The beautiful woman says 'Lord Kyle often comes here to pray for
guidance. I don't mind, this land is as much his as it is mine and of
course I would not mind to see the constellations shine like they
once did for Vinas. The last time that he arrived, though, Lord Kyle
seemed to be quite shaken. He was mumbling about the Measure, though
I would guess all of you knights must whisper the rules of the order
in order to keep them close?'

The woman kneels before the stone in reverence and then nods at you.

Lord Kyle turns to you and examines you, sizing you up. Finally he seems to
drop his guard and leans against a wall.

"All my life I've been adventuring, from my years as a squire up until I
became the Lord of this city and the surrounding country. Sure, it's an
honor to serve under Lord Gunthar and be in charge of this town, but it's
just not the same, you know? Me and Frank over there used to explore all
over the continent, looking mainly for old Ergothian stuff. Now here we are
in this place surrounded by safety. What I'd give to relive those days."

Lord Kyle turns around and heaves a sigh, and looks out the window again.

Lord Kyle stands abruptly from his desk and walks to the window. He
turns over his shoulder for a brief moment and then returns his gaze
outside to the streets of Garret.

Lord Kyle says 'Est Sularus oth Mithas. My honor is my life. Yes, the
oath remains strong here in Garret and the people live by it. Grand
Master Gunthar Uth Winstan has recently finished his revision to the
Measure originally authored by Vinas Solmanus. Of course, the basis
of the document remains. The meaning, philosophy and depth of the
rules cannot be changed. However, as the river of time flows there
comes a need to keep the norms of the order in check with the
evolution of society, else we would be lost and crumble to dust.'

Lord Kyle sighs as he scans the street, then turns from the window
and stares at you before continuing 'The original measure was 37
volumes each of which contained over 300 pages. I am sure you
remember this from your initial training as a squire. In any case,
the revised version of the Measure was completed and signed by Grand
Master Gunthar and authorized for travel to the High Clerist's Tower
where it would be interpreted by the elders and its meaning
propagated through the order.'

Leaning over his desk, Lord Kyle continues, 'The caravan never made
it. We made travel plans with Emperor Mercadior to meet us at the dock
of Gulfport and arrange travel safely through Hylo, past the pirates
beyond and to Palanthas where gracious Lord Amothus was awaiting. He
was to supply sustenance to our knights and help them continue the
last leg of the journey to the Tower. The caravan never made it to
Gulfport and now there is the only the worst to fear.

Sitting down, Lord Kyle opens his desk drawer and pulls out a
bloodied piece of paper. He looks at it and grips it firmly, before
pushing it over for you to read.
