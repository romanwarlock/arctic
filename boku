The gaunt, sunken features of this pilgrim's face portray his devotion to
his religion, sacrificing his own personal well being to prove his loyalty
to the Dark Queen. His physical frame is thin and wiry, a result of regular
fasting whilst seeking the council of Takhisis. Regardless of his slight
physical stature the pilgrim walks with an aura of confidence and
arrogance, as though he understands things that simpler folk do not.
A dark pilgrim is in an excellent condition.

The healer looks up from his work and speaks with a sadness in his voice:

'I am glad you are here to help us, we desperately are in need of
heroes such as yourselves. The task is difficult, I hope you can do it.'

'We have always lived in peace in this vast forest, few knew that we even
existed until several weeks ago. It is then the crystal castle came. With
the arrival of the castle, our forest turned on us. The trees became
infected with some strange disease, as did my people. The nature of this
disease is so powerful that I cannot cure it on my own.'

'There is, however, something that can save us. You must find the
ingredients for a powerful healing salve that only I know of. It is a
mixture of only two things: some bark strips off the trees in the forest
and some sap from the golden tree. I sent someone out to look for these
items, but he has not returned and I fear the worst. Find him if you can,
he may have already obtained the bark.'

'The golden tree is hidden within the forest. A division of kobolds arrived
soon after the castle and took up residence in the southern part of the
forest. They have not bothered us, but I suspect they seek the golden tree
and may well have found it already. You must find the tree before they do.'

'As a final warning, the magic of the tree is very powerful. It is short lived,
but to those who use its sap, wondrous magics may be obtained. It is therefore
important you remove the kobold menace and prevent them from reaching the tree.'

The healer wishes you good luck and drops a huge chopping axe at your feet.
It is likely you will need it.

This rather burly kobold looks very strong. He has a pair of spectacles on
his snout and is looking at some blueprints. He is garbed in a thick, dirty
jacket and dirty pants. As he goes over the plans, he snorts and makes
notes. With all the noise and racket going on, it's hard to believe he can
get any work done. It is probably the tremendous noise that prevents him
from hearing you enter, too.
